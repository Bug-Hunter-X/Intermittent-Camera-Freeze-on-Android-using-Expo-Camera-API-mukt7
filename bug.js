This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview might freeze or display a black screen after a short period, rendering the component unusable.  This isn't consistently reproducible across all devices or even consistently on the same device, making debugging challenging.  The error doesn't throw any specific Javascript exceptions in the console, adding to the difficulty of identifying the root cause.
